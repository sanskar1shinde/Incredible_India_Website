					<p class="card__description">
						
						
					Our team of textile designers & curators closely work with the Chhipa Community of Akola & Bagru in Rajasthan and artisans of Nandana located in the Neemuch district, Madhya Pradesh. Each district has its own unique taste of printing Dabu! While Bagru remains the heart of Dabu printing, Akola is known for precision and additional detail in production hence resulting in 80% less bleeding.

				<p class="card__description">
				Known for its rich sacred history, heritage & opulent textile crafts, Banaras (Varanasi) is one city that needs no institutional recognition. We love roving to cities that are backed with deep-rooted tales, strolling on the ghats of Banaras and attending the holy Ganga Aarti makes us fall in love with this city all over again. While the weavers still strive to keep the legacy of handwoven Banarasi alive in certain parts of the city, the surging demands has to lead to the introduction of the power loom.

				<h2 class="card__title">Ajrak</h2>
				<p class="card__description">
				A textile craft highly revered amongst the Khatri Community, Ajrak found its way to India in the 16th century routing its way from the Sindh province to Kutch, Gujarat. With artisans spread across Dhamadka Village & Ajrakhpur until date, their brave stories of continuing to keep the legacy of this textile craft intact even after the disastrous Bhuj Earthquake in 2001 is indeed inspiring and noteworthy. Our team of textile designers work with artisans spread across Barmer and Bhuj, featuring a mix of earthy and bright prints!
