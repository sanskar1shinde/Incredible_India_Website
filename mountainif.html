				The Purvanchal Range can be considered as the extension of Himalayas in the eastern part of India as the process of formation of this range is quite similar to that of Himalayas, although the range is not as high as the Himalayas.
The Purvanchal Range or the Eastern Mountain Range comprises three parts: The Patkai-Bum Hill, The Garo-Khasi-Jaintia Hills and Lushai Hill (Mizo Hill).
